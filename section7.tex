\section{Statement of individual contribution}
\texttt{Vandana:} Responsibilities included, collection of relevant data sets, conduct literature survey, creating a scheme to assign fake user ratings to all the products (making sure that they are unbaised and purely random) and creation the dataloader for the deep ranking model. Analyzed and decided the architecture/model for our initial approach. 
\\

\noindent \texttt{Sathwik:} Created a model for deep image ranking based on literature survey, set up training scripts, trained Resnet50 model on the deep fashion dataset, conducted various experiments to select best hyper-parameters for the model. Yet to do : Setup training scripts for a multi scale approach and possibly a Fast RCNN inspired model. 
\\

\noindent \texttt{Rahul:} Experimented with the short listed set of candidate models to create an ensemble model with best performance attributes, arrived at an effective scoring function which will be used to score all images prior to training which will help to sample in-class negative examples.
